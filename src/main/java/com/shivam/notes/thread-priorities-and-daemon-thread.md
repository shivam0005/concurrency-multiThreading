# ðŸ§µ 1. Thread Priorities
    
`Each Java thread has a priority â€” an integer from 1 to 10 â€” that suggests to the thread scheduler 
how important the thread is.`

Java constants for priority:

    Thread.MIN_PRIORITY = 1  
    Thread.NORM_PRIORITY = 5 (default)  
    Thread.MAX_PRIORITY = 10  

The OS and JVM may or may not strictly follow priorities â€” it's just a hint.


# ðŸ”¸ How to Set/Get Priority:

    Thread t = new Thread(() -> System.out.println("Running"));
    t.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY);
    System.out.println(t.getPriority()); // 10

ðŸ“Œ Best practice: Set priorities only when you have a strong use case. Don't rely on them for correctness.


# ðŸ”¸ Common Use Case

You might give higher priority to tasks that:

* Must run faster than others (e.g., UI thread, logging, alerts)
* Require quick CPU cycles in a compute-heavy environment

But for most backend apps, priority is rarely used.


# ðŸ‘» 2. Daemon Threads

A daemon thread is a background thread that:

* Runs in the background (e.g., garbage collector, monitoring tasks)
* Doesnâ€™t block JVM shutdown
* Is killed automatically when all user threads finish
