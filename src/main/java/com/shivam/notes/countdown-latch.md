# 🧠 What is CountDownLatch?

A synchronization aid that allows one or more threads to wait until a set of operations being 
performed in other threads completes.

**Real-life Analogy:**

    Imagine a relay race where the final runner waits until all team members finish 
    their legs. That’s CountDownLatch.


# Constructor:

    CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(int count);
    
    The count is the number of times countDown() must be called before await() stops blocking.


# ✅ Common Use Cases

| Scenario                             | Behavior                                                             |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Wait for multiple threads to finish  | Main thread calls `latch.await()`, worker threads call `countDown()` |
| One-time gate                        | Threads wait until "GO" is signaled                                  |
| Testing/concurrent task coordination | Useful in stress/load tests                                          |



# ⚠️ Important Notes:

| Method        | Purpose                                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `await()`     | Waits until count reaches zero             |
| `countDown()` | Decrements count (must be called manually) |
| Thread-safe?  | ✅ Yes, can be shared across many threads   |


# 🧠 Key Points:

* CountDownLatch is one-time-use only — once the count reaches zero, it cannot be reset.
* If you want reusable coordination, you'll need CyclicBarrier or Semaphore (coming next!).



# 🔁 CountDownLatch vs Thread.join()

| Feature                        | `CountDownLatch`                   | `Thread.join()`                      |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 🔁 Reusable?                   | ❌ One-time use only                | ✅ Can be reused on same thread       |
| 🔄 Multiple thread wait?       | ✅ One latch, many waiters          | ❌ Each thread needs separate join    |
| 📦 Part of executor framework? | ✅ Works well with thread pools     | ❌ Requires individual thread objects |
| 🧪 More test-friendly?         | ✅ Great for coordinating test flow | ❌ Limited to known threads           |
| ⏳ Timeout support?             | ✅ `await(timeout)` available       | ✅ `join(timeout)` also available     |



* Want to coordinate many threads finishing a job? → Use CountDownLatch.
* Just want to wait for one known thread? → Use join().
